# Binary file config specification

The 2 basic requirements of a config specification are:

1. To be able to mark sections of a binary file, and display their data members in different colors.
2. To be able to identify an offset value and where it must point, with the focus on enabling auto-update to the offset value should bytes be added to/removed from the binary file.
